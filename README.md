#SACNet
Our project is built on the foundation of Hong et al.'s research. What you are currently seeing is experimental code, and some class names and variable names may be confusing. 
We will upload the cleaned and standardized code as soon as possible.
If you are not familiar with MMdetection2, you can use the scripts we provide for training and validation.

我们的项目建立在Hong等人的研究基础上，目前您看到的是实验性的代码，一些类名和变量名称可能是令人困惑的。
我们将尽快上传经过整理的规范代码。如果您不熟悉MMdetection2，可以使用我们提供的脚本进行训练和验证。
